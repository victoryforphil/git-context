# GitHub Repository Indexer - Requirements

## Project Overview

The GitHub Repository Indexer is a Next.js web application designed to solve the problem of AI agents not being able to efficiently index and access GitHub repository contents. The tool generates AI-friendly markdown context by recursively crawling repository structures and creating direct raw file links.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **URL Input Support**
   - Repository root URLs: `https://github.com/user/repo`
   - Specific folder paths: `https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch/folder`
   - Individual file paths: `https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/file.ext`

2. **Repository Crawling**
   - Recursive directory traversal with configurable depth limits
   - Support for different branches (main, master, develop, etc.)
   - File filtering capabilities (by extension, size, etc.)
   - Rate limiting to respect GitHub API limits

3. **Raw URL Generation**
   - Convert GitHub blob URLs to raw.githubusercontent.com URLs
   - Maintain proper path structure and branch references
   - Handle special characters and encoding in file paths

4. **Output Generation**
   - Generate structured markdown with file tree representation
   - Include direct raw links for each file
   - Provide metadata (file count, directory depth, repository info)
   - Export options (copy to clipboard, download as .md file)

### Technical Requirements

1. **API Integration**
   - GitHub API v4 (GraphQL) for efficient data fetching
   - GitHub API v3 (REST) as fallback
   - Authentication support (optional GitHub token for higher rate limits)
   - Error handling for private repositories and API limits

2. **Performance**
   - Client-side caching of repository data
   - Progressive loading for large repositories
   - Background processing with progress indicators
   - Debounced input handling

3. **User Experience**
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Real-time preview of generated markdown
   - Interactive file tree with expand/collapse
   - Copy-to-clipboard functionality
   - Download generated context as file

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Initial load time < 2 seconds
- Repository processing time < 30 seconds for typical repos
- Support for repositories with up to 1000 files

### Scalability
- Client-side processing to avoid server costs
- Efficient memory usage for large file trees
- Lazy loading for large directory structures

### Usability
- Intuitive single-page interface
- Clear error messages and validation
- Mobile-responsive design
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Security
- No storage of repository data
- Client-side only processing
- Optional GitHub token handling (stored locally)
- HTTPS-only communications

## User Stories

### Primary Users: AI/ML Engineers and Developers

1. **As a developer**, I want to provide AI agents with comprehensive repository context so they can better understand my codebase structure and dependencies.

2. **As an AI researcher**, I want to quickly generate training data from GitHub repositories by extracting file contents and structure.

3. **As a technical writer**, I want to create documentation that references specific files in repositories with direct links to their contents.

4. **As a code reviewer**, I want to share repository context with team members or AI tools for analysis.

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**
   - Successfully processes 95%+ of public GitHub repositories
   - Generates accurate raw URLs for all supported file types
   - Handles edge cases (empty repos, single files, deep nesting)

2. **Performance**
   - Average processing time < 15 seconds for repos with < 100 files
   - UI remains responsive during processing
   - Memory usage stays under 100MB for typical use cases

3. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive workflow requiring minimal user input
   - Clear visual feedback during processing
   - Easy sharing and export of generated context

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- Batch processing of multiple repositories
- Integration with popular AI platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Repository comparison and diff generation
- Custom filtering and organization rules

### Phase 3 Features
- Support for other version control platforms (GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Team collaboration features
- API for programmatic access
- Browser extension for direct GitHub integration

## Technical Constraints

1. **GitHub API Limits**
   - 60 requests/hour for unauthenticated users
   - 5000 requests/hour for authenticated users
   - Must implement proper rate limiting and error handling

2. **Browser Limitations**
   - CORS restrictions for direct GitHub API calls
   - Memory constraints for large repositories
   - Storage limitations for caching

3. **File Size Limits**
   - GitHub has a 100MB file size limit
   - Raw file access may be limited for very large files
   - Need to handle binary files appropriately

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- GitHub API changes breaking functionality
- Rate limiting affecting user experience
- Large repositories causing browser performance issues

### Medium Risk
- Private repository access complications
- Edge cases in URL parsing and conversion
- Browser compatibility issues

### Low Risk
- UI/UX refinement needs
- Performance optimization requirements
- Feature scope creep
